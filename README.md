NOTE TO DEVELOPERS: 
Please add your own environment variables to any cloned version of this repo in order to successfully connect locally to the two included databses. 

In the main folder, create two files named .env.test and .env.deleopment, to reference either database as required. Within the file(s), use the syntax: "PGDATABASE=database_name_here" and include the appropriate database name.

PLEASE MAKE SURE THESE FILES ARE ADDED TO .gitignore and that the database names are not shared publicly!
